            The following is a collection of video game scripts that I've found across the internet.
            I found that they were a great tool for studying Japanese but I wanted to customize them for my study usage.

            I have a setup that I use for playing games in Japanese. Click here for more information:<br />

        Script Generation
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="subdescription">
            The scripts are cleaned up through an automated process. The cleaning process is not perfect and there are
            likely weird errors, although I have tried to minimize these.

        <div class="subdescription">
            Games are partitioned according to the text source. So, for example, Final Fantasy 7's script
            has a few long pages whereas Final Fantasy 8's script is divided across many pages, but each page is short.

            The code to generate all of the script files is available on
